# CS4261-Project
Problem - Furniture with reusable potential is being thrown out in large amounts, while buying new furniture is expensive and buying used furniture has a small market that is not reliable.
Our solution will utilize a pool of drivers, similar to that of Uber or Lift. These drivers will be able to pick up old furniture items, and store those items in our warehouse to be sold. Note, the drivers will only make money if the items sell.
