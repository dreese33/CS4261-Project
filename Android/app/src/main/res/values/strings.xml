    <string name="user_desc">There are two types of accounts: users and drivers. As a driver, you
        will be notified of items that may be worth picking up in the area.
        It will be your decision to pick the items up if you deem them as valuable and to be sold
        at our local stores. Note: you will only make money if the items sell.
        Are you up for the challenge?</string>
